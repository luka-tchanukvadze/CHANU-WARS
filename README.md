ðŸŒŒ CHANU WARS: The Ultimate Star Wars Experience
- Welcome to CHANU WARS, the project where your love for Star Wars meets creativity and technology. ðŸš€ This isn't just another project, it's a massive, ever-evolving Star Wars universe in the making. Whether you're a die-hard fan or someone who's just curious, this project is here to inspire you to dive deep into the Star Wars saga and maybe even create something of your own.

ðŸš¨ What's Inside?
CHANU WARS is built around three core projects that will keep you exploring:

1. Star Wars Lore (ðŸ’¡ Learn & Share)
Ever felt overwhelmed by the Star Wars universe? Now you donâ€™t have to be! Explore a comprehensive lore section where you can learn about the entire Star Wars universe. Better yet, you can add your own knowledge or check out what other fans have shared. Whether it's deep lore or cool fan theoriesâ€”thereâ€™s always something new to discover.

2. Online Shop (ðŸ›’ Be the Jedi of Shopping)
A fully functional online shop to feed your Star Wars obsession. From lightsabers to ship models, get everything you need to power up your fandom!

3. Starship Fighting Game (ðŸ›¸ Ships Battle!)
Take control of your own Star Wars ship in epic space battles! The game is live, and you can jump in right now to battle it out in the galaxy. Whether you're outmaneuvering your enemies or blasting them into space dust, this is your chance to prove you're the ultimate star pilot. Play it now and may the Force be with you!

ðŸ’» Tech Stack (What Powers the Galaxy)
- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion (because animations should be as smooth as Han Solo).
- Backend: Node.js with Express, and MongoDB (for storing all that intergalactic data).
- And thatâ€™s just the beginning. This project will grow, evolve, and expand, just like the Star Wars universe itself.

ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next?
- The future holds so much for CHANU WARS:

- Adding Jest to test and ensure every button, every API call, every space battle works perfectly.
- Bringing in AI chat so you can talk with characters, droids, or even Yoda himself!
 -And of course, the current starship fighting game was added as a learning exercise to figure out how to implement Three.js in React. But soon, Iâ€™ll be creating my own game from scratch - so stay tuned for something even more exciting!

Why Should You Care?
- Honestly, if youâ€™re not already hyped to watch the Star Wars saga, CHANU WARS might just push you over the edge. The lore, the shop, the shipsâ€”itâ€™s all designed to spark that excitement. So buckle up, because this is the way.
